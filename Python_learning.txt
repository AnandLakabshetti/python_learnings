pip is a python package manageer.

inbuilt packages we can import directly otherwise we have to install
the modules and then we have to import in program to use it in program.


Two types of modules:
   build in modules--> these will be installed in system i.e os 
   external modules -> need to install externally i.e flask

#string in python 



### In 3 way we can declare the string 

st='my name is anand'
st1="my name is anand"
st2='''my name is anand
anand is my name '''


1)"it's mine "
2)'''it"s mine'''
3)'it"s mine"s'


s1+s2---> string concatination

st[0] --> first character of the string 
st[0:] --> from first character to last character it will print 
st[:] --> it will print all character
st[:5] --> it will print from first character to 5th character 
#st [start index : last index]
st[-4:] -->character from the last 4th to till end it will print 

st[0:5:2] --> it will print each character with step of '2' upto first 5 character
